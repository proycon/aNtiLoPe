# PICCL: Philosophical Integrator of Computational and Corpus Libraries

PICCL offers a workflow for corpus building and builds on a variety of tools.
The primary component of PICCL is TICCL; a Text-induced Corpus Clean-up system, which
performs spelling correction and OCR post-correction (normalisation of spelling
variants etc).

PICCL and TICCL constitute original research by Martin Reynaert (Tilburg University & Radboud University Nijmegen), and
is currently developed in the scope of the [CLARIAH](https://www.clariah.nl) project.

This repository hosts the relevant workflows that constitute PICCL, powered by
[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io). These will be shipped as part of our
[LaMachine](https://proycon.github.io/LaMachine) software distribution.

The modules that make up TICCL are part of the [TicclTools](https://github.com/LanguageMachines/ticcltools) collection.

**Note**: This is a new experimental version in early stages; for the old version consult [this repository](https://github.com/martinreynaert/TICCL).
